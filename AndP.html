           Best time to visit Andhra Pradesh
         </h1>
        
         <p>Best time to visit Andhra Pradesh is during the winter season, i.e. between November and February when the weather is pleasant and comfortable for the tourists to visit all the tourist attractions. Andhra Pradesh is least recommended during summer as the temperature can hit a maximum of 45°C, making it an incredibly inconvenient option to travel to the state. Heavy rainfall and high humidity levels are experienced during the monsoons which may not be what most tourists are looking for. </p>

     <p>Andhra Pradesh has always been known for its rich musical heritage. This land has given birth to three legends in the world of Carnatic music namely Shyama Sastri, Thyagaraja and Muthuswami Dixtar. Since the Telugu language is spoken by most people in the state, it is, therefore, able to bring out the originality and the true spirit of the Carnatic music. Some famous Carnatic music composers include Kshetrayya, Annamacharya and Bhadrachala Ramadasa. This type of music is also said to be begun by the Holy Gods. Another very famous kind of music which has said to be originated from Carnatic music is folk music. This art has been passed on to the descendants over the years. Every music has a distinctive feature meaning that every composition of music has a different version altogether. The musical element and the hidden meaning behind the song is what makes it more meaningful and attractive. Another feature which separates the Carnatic music from the rest of the music is the fact that the song is always able to bring out the personality of the song composer completely thereby increasing the level of the language in the music.</p>

     <p>Andhra Pradesh’s rich history of dynasties and kingdoms influenced the architecture significantly. The Dravidian style of architecture is intertwined with cultural practices of rulers from Chola, Chalukyas, Vijayanagar, Satavahanas and Gajapati empires. There are many Buddhist and Hindu temples that resemble the trademark Dravidian style, towering stone structures that are decorated with carvings of religious deities and symbols. Intricate details and flawless engravings are visible on almost every monument dating from that time. Diversity of the architecture compliments the harmony of the Telugu culture brilliantly.

     <p>Telugu is the official language spoken by natives in Andhra Pradesh and neighbouring states. It is one of the ancient Dravidian languages, dating back to first millennium AD. Many scholars have found inscriptions in Telugu from 500 BC to 100 BC, proving its existence goes way back. Even though it originates from Proto-Dravidian sub-language, literary experts have confirmed its connection to Sanskrit as well as Hindi. Ancient poets  Nannaya, Tikkana and Yerrapragada constitute the holy ‘Trinity of Poets’ that are credited for reviving the language and promoting its vocabulary through popular translational works like Mahabharata.

     <p>Andhra Pradesh, like many Indian states, is a rich concoction of cultures, religious practices, traditions, beliefs and ethnicity. Ethnic tribesmen and urban citizens live in perfect harmony and you will see natives coming together, celebrating festivals like Ugadi (Telugu New Year), Makar Sankranti, Ram Navami, Maha Shivratri, Dasara and Diwali. Many citizens still believe in ancient traditions and pursue them sincerely. Muggulu is one such tradition where people decorate entrances with white rice powder. These age-old traditions are prevalent in many households and may vary depending on ethnicity. This is a speciality of Andhra Pradesh.

      There lies a huge difference in reading about the culture and traditions of a place and actually witnessing it and experiencing it all together. Every state, district, country and even every house follow a different lifestyle which distinctly identifies it from the rest. So do the practices carried out by the people of Andhra Pradesh. This state is a land full of fun, frolic, laughter, and life which has not yet been discovered by more than half of the population. As can be made out from the article, the culture of Andhra Pradesh is rich in terms of its food, clothing, festivals, dance, music, paintings or any other forte. The state has a lot to offer for those who want to be a part of it and appreciate its beauty. Plan a trip and see for yourself what a beautiful life lies at the place with the exact kind of peace and harmony that is required in the world today but goes missing.
